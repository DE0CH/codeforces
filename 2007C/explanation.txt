Suppose we are only given one integer, d, we can solve it greedily.

Theorem 1. equivalently we can not only add d, but also subtract d from a number. Let's call this addition or subtraction "moving" an element in the array.

Proof 1. subtracting d is equivalent to adding d to all the other elements in the array

Now for two integers a and b, the problem can be reduced to solving it for one integer d, which is the gcd of a and b.

Theorem 2. The value for which you can add or subtract a number by any combination of moves is a multiple of d.

Proof 2. Bezout's identity. Omitted. Check wikipedia.

You can find the range of an array modulo d by first sorting the array, and then two adjacent elements as the smallest and largest.

Complexity: O(N log N)
